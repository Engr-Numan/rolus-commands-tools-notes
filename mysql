MYSQL SETUP ON =======>>>>

Install and Configure MySQL Server (CentOS)
Introduction
MySQL server is one of the most popular and widely-used relational databases. In this Lab, you will be tasked with installing a MySQL server on CentOS 7, and ensuring that it has been properly secured.

Scenario
As database administrators for our company, we have been tasked with performing the initial installation of a MySQL server. In order to perform this task, we will need to download the appropriate RPM files from the MySQL server downloads page. Once we have obtained the RPM files, we will need to install the MySQL server, update the password for the super user, and ensure that the server has been properly secured. To secure the MySQL server, we will need to make sure that anonymous users are removed, remote root login is disabled, the test database has been removed, and that the privilege tables have been reloaded.

Additional Information:

All steps should be performed as cloud_user, using sudo when necessary. For convenience, a password is not required when using sudo
Our working directory should be /home/cloud_user.
The URL for the MySQL RPM Bundle tar file is here: https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-8.0/mysql-8.0.15-1.el7.x86_64.rpm-bundle.tar
For grading purposes, we will need to update the password for the root user to Linux4me!.
Get Logged In
Use the credentials and server IP in the hands-on lab overview page to log into our lab server. Once that's done, we can get moving.

Download the MySQL RPM Bundle tar File from the MySQL Community Server Downloads Page
While in the cloud_user home directory ( run pwd to make sure we're in /home/cloud_user) and then run the following:

# [cloud_user@host]$ wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-8.0/mysql-8.0.15-1.el7.x86_64.rpm-bundle.tar
If we run a quick ls when the file is done downloading, we should see listed here.

Extract the RPM Files from the MySQL Bundle tar File
In the cloud_user’s home directory, Use the tar command to extract the RPM files from the bundle tar file:

# [cloud_user@host]$ tar -xvf mysql-8.0.15-1.el7.x86_64.rpm-bundle.tar

We can run ls again to see everything that got extracted.

Install the MySQL Server and Dependencies Using the rpm Command
In cloud_user’s home directory, use the rpm command to install the MySQL server and dependencies:

# [cloud_user@host]$ sudo rpm -Uvh mysql-community-{server,client,common,libs}-*
Start up the MySQL Server
Use systemctl to start up the mysqld service, and check its state:

# [cloud_user@host]$ sudo systemctl start mysqld
# [cloud_user@host]$ sudo systemctl status mysqld
Update the Password for the MySQL Superuser Account
Locate the temporary password for the superuser:

# [cloud_user@host]$ sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
Using the temporary password, log into the MySQL server as the root user:

# [cloud_user@host]$ # mysql -u root -p
Update the password for the root user:

mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<NEW_PASSWORD>';
For grading purposes, make sure NEW_PASSWORD is Linux4me!.

Exit the mysql prompt:

mysql> exit
Secure the MySQL Server Installation
Begin the installation by running the mysql_secure_installation command:

# cloud_user@host]$ mysql_secure_installation
Answer the following questions to complete the secure installation:

Change the password for root ? n
Remove anonymous users? y
Disallow root login remotely? y
Remove test database and access to it? y
Reload privilege tables now? y
Conclusion
We're finished here. We installed MySQL, and have it set up in a secure state, just like we were asked to do. Congratulations!

Backup and Restore Databases in MySQL-------------------<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


Introduction
In MySQL server administration, it is important to safeguard data in case of human error or a system failure. To accomplish this, MySQL provides the ability to create backups of databases and tables. In this lab, we will create backups for individual databases and tables, as well as full backups of the MySQL server. We will also restore the MySQL server from a complete backup.

The Scenario
Our team has been charged with creating backups for the MySQL server, as part of our departments disaster recovery initiative. First we will need to create a partial backup of the prod database that only includes the products table. This backup file should be named prod_products.sql. Next, we need to create a full backup of the dev and test databases, which include all tables. This backup file should be named dev_test.sql. Then we have to create a full backup of all the databases within the MySQL server, and this file should be named full_backup.sql.

Lastly, we will need to create delimited-text dump files of the prod database. These dump files should be created in the /var/lib/mysql-files directory. Once all of the backup files have been created, we will need to perform a full restore of the MySQL server using the mysql_dump.sql file located in the /home/cloud_user directory.

Getting Logged In
Use the credentials and server IP in the hands-on lab overview page to log into our lab server.

Create a Partial Backup of the prod Database That Only Includes the products Table
Run following command as cloud_user to create a backup of just the products table in the prod database:

# mysqldump -u root -p prod products > prod_products.sql
Create Full Backups of the dev and test Databases
Run following command to create backups of the dev and test databases:

# mysqldump -u root -p --databases dev test > dev_test.sql
Create a Complete Backup of All the Databases on the MySQL Server
Use the following command to create a full backup of all the databases on the MySQL server:

# mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > full_backup.sql
Create Delimited-Text Dump Files of the prod Database in the /var/lib/mysql-files Directory
Run the following command to create delimited-text dump files of the prod database in /var/lib/mysql-files (the use of sudo does not require a password in this lab, so the prompt is for the MySQL root user, using the password Linux4me!:

# sudo mysqldump -u root -p --tab=/var/lib/mysql-files/ prod
Show what got dumped out with this command:

sudo ls /var/lib/mysql-files/
Let's take a look at one:

sudo cat orders.txt
We'll see that it's just a raw dump of the data in that table.

Perform a Full Restore of the Databases on the MySQL Server by Reloading the msyql_dump.sql Dump File Located in the /home/cloud_user Directory
To perform a full restore of the MySQL server, run the following command from the /home/cloud_user directory:

# mysql -u root -p < mysql_dump.sql
And to check, let's get to a MySQL prompt:

mysql -u root -p
Once we enter the password, we'll run a query from the mysql> prompt:

SELECT * FROM prod.orders;
We'll see six entries there, and there were only five in the orders.txt file we looked at earlier, so we know that this is in fact different data (which came from msyql_dump.sql).


================================================================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================================================================





Creating Users and Managing Privileges in MySQL
The Scenario
Our company has hired four new employees, and they need access to the MySQL server. As our company's database administrators, it's our job to create these user accounts and grant them specific privileges to databases and tables within the server. In addition to this, we will need to remove the user account of an employee who has recently left the company, and modify the privileges of a current employee who has been moved to a different position.

Getting Logged In
Use the credentials and server IP in the hands-on lab overview page to log into our lab server. Refer back to that page for other usernames and passwords as we need them. Once we're logged into the server itself, log into MySQL as root:

[cloud_user@host]$ mysql -u root -p
We're ready to proceed.

Create the Users
This will create the four users, and only allow logins from localhost:

mysql>  CREATE USER 'corey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Linux4you!','will'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Linux4you!','mike'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Linux4you!','myles'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Linux4you!';
Check if the new users got created with this:

mysql> SELECT User FROM mysql.user
Delete a User
Delete the user stosh using the DROP statement:

mysql>DROP USER 'stosh'@'localhost';
Grant Privileges on the Newly Created Users
Grant all privileges on the dev database to the corey user:

mysql> GRANT ALL ON dev.* TO 'corey'@'localhost';
Grant INSERT and SELECT privileges on the products table in the dev database to will:

mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON dev.products TO 'will'@'localhost';
Grant ALL privileges on the prod database to the mike user:

mysql> GRANT ALL ON prod.* TO 'mike'@'localhost';
Grant SELECT privileges on the products table in the prod database to myles user:

mysql> GRANT SELECT ON prod.products TO 'myles'@'localhost';
View any user's privileges with this (substituting usernames and hosts with whatever we want to check):

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user@host`;
Revoke a Privilege
Revoke the INSERT privilege from the kenny user running the following command:

mysql> REVOKE INSERT ON prod.orders FROM 'kenny'@'localhost';
Validate the Changes
If we want to manually test whether our changes have worked out and been implemented how we expected, we can log in as those users and attempt to run queries.

Ensure that the user corey does not have access to the prod database. Run the following as the corey user:

mysql> SELECT * FROM prod.orders;
Ensure that the user will does not have access to the orders table on the dev database. Run the following as the will user:

mysql> SELECT * FROM dev.orders;
Ensure that the user mike does not have access to the dev database. Run the following as the mike user:

mysql> SELECT * FROM dev.orders;
Ensure that the user myles does not have access to the orders table in the prod database. Run the following as the myles user:

mysql> SELECT * FROM prod.orders;
Ensure that the user kenny does not have INSERT privileges on the orders table in the prod database. Run the following as the kenny user:

mysql> INSERT INTO prod.orders (orderID,userName,orderType,purchaseDate) VALUES (4,'mike','laptop','2018-04-08');

Real Implementation , Notes made by self by dooing R n D.



How to install mysql 5.7 on centos8:  
Step 1: Add MySQL repository
First, you need to Disable MySQL from the default AppStream repository.

# dnf module disable mysqlsudo 
Now, add MySQL repositories to your system.

# vim /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo
Paste the below data into the MySQL repo file.

[mysql57-community]
name=MySQL 5.7 Community Server
baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[mysql-connectors-community]
name=MySQL Connectors Community
baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-connectors-community/el/7/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[mysql-tools-community]
name=MySQL Tools Community
baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-tools-community/el/7/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
Step 2: Install MySQL 5.7
Now, the new MySQL repository is available on the system and we are ready to install MySQL 5.7 from the repository.

Disable MySQL 8 repository:

# dnf config-manager --disable mysql80-community
Enable MySQL 5.7 repository:

# dnf config-manager --enable mysql57-community
Now, you are ready to install MySQL 5.7:

# dnf install mysql-community-server



sometime it will throw error :::::::::::::

You can remove cached packages by executing 'dnf clean packages'.
Error: Transaction test error:
  file /etc/my.cnf from install of mysql-community-server-5.7.44-1.el7.x86_64 conflicts with file from package mariadb-connector-c-config-3.1.11-2.el8_3.noarch

it means it is createing conflict with mariadb-connector-c-config-3.1.11-2.e18_3.noarch...

so you should have to remove mariadb. by using below command ::

# sudo dnf remove mariadb-connector-c-config

then again execute installation command:....

#   dnf install mysql-community-server
